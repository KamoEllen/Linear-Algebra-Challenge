## 1. Dot Product Fundamentals

### 1.1 Basic Definition
The dot product takes two vectors and produces a scalar (number):
- 2D: **a**·**b** = (a₁×b₁) + (a₂×b₂)
- 3D: **a**·**b** = (a₁×b₁) + (a₂×b₂) + (a₃×b₃)
- n-D: **a**·**b** = Σ(aᵢ×bᵢ) for i = 1 to n

### 1.2 Key Properties
1. Commutative: **a**·**b** = **b**·**a**
2. Distributive: (**a** + **b**)·**c** = (**a**·**c**) + (**b**·**c**)
3. Scalar Multiplication: c(**a**·**b**) = (c**a**)·**b** = **a**·(c**b**)
4. Self-Product: **a**·**a** ≥ 0 (equals 0 only for zero vector)

### 1.3 Worked Examples
```
Example 1 (2D):
a = [3, 5]
b = [8, 2]
a·b = (3×8) + (5×2) = 24 + 10 = 34

Example 2 (3D):
a = [2, -1, 3]
b = [4, 2, -1]
a·b = (2×4) + (-1×2) + (3×-1)
    = 8 + (-2) + (-3)
    = 3
```

## 2. Vector Basics & Geometric Interpretation

### 2.1 Standard Position
Vectors are represented as arrows with:
- Starting point at origin (0,0,0)
- Ending point at coordinates (x₁, x₂, x₃, ...)

### 2.2 Vector Length (Norm)
```
||v|| = √(v·v)
- 2D: ||v|| = √(v₁² + v₂²)
- 3D: ||v|| = √(v₁² + v₂² + v₃²)

Example:
v = [3, 4]
||v|| = √(3² + 4²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5
```

### 2.3 Direction Relationships
- Positive dot product → vectors point similarly
- Zero dot product → vectors are perpendicular
- Negative dot product → vectors point oppositely

### 2.4 Unit Vectors
```
Standard basis vectors:
e₁ = [1, 0, 0]
e₂ = [0, 1, 0]
e₃ = [0, 0, 1]

To normalize: û = u/||u||

Example:
v = [3, 4]
||v|| = 5
û = [3/5, 4/5]
```

### 2.5 Distance Between Vectors
Formula: ||u - v|| = √((u₁-v₁)² + (u₂-v₂)²)

```
Example:
u = [1, 4]
v = [3, 1]
Distance = √((1-3)² + (4-1)²)
        = √(4 + 9)
        = √13
```

## 3. Orthogonal Sets & Complements

### 3.1 Orthogonal Vectors
Two vectors are orthogonal if:
1. Their dot product = 0
2. ||u - v|| = ||u + v||

```
Example:
u = [3, 4]
v = [-4, 3]
u·v = (3×-4) + (4×3) = -12 + 12 = 0
Therefore, u and v are orthogonal
```

### 3.2 Orthogonal Set Example
```
Check if these vectors form an orthogonal set:
u₁ = [3, 1, 1]
u₂ = [-1, 2, 1]
u₃ = [-1/2, -2, 7/2]

Checking all pairs:
1. u₁·u₂ = (3×-1) + (1×2) + (1×1) = -3 + 2 + 1 = 0 ✓
2. u₁·u₃ = (3×-1/2) + (1×-2) + (1×7/2) = -3/2 - 2 + 7/2 = 0 ✓
3. u₂·u₃ = (-1×-1/2) + (2×-2) + (1×7/2) = 1/2 - 4 + 7/2 = 0 ✓

All pairs are orthogonal, so this is an orthogonal set!
```

### 3.3 Orthogonal Complements
- W⊥ (W-perp) = set of all vectors orthogonal to W
- If W is a plane, W⊥ is the line perpendicular to W

Important Relationships:
1. Column space(A)⊥ = Null space(Aᵀ)
2. Row space(A)⊥ = Null space(A)

## 4. Vector Projections & Decomposition

### 4.1 Decomposition Formula
Any vector u can be split into:
1. w₁ (parallel to v): [(u·v)/(||v||²)]×v
2. w₂ (perpendicular to v): u - w₁

```
Visual Representation:
        u
       ↗
      /  
w₁   /   w₂
→   /     ↑
   /      |
  /   θ   |
 /________|
    v
```

### 4.2 Detailed Example
```
Given:
y = [0, 3, -5]
u = [1, -2, 4]

Step 1: Calculate y·u
y·u = (0×1) + (3×-2) + (-5×4) = 0 - 6 - 20 = -26

Step 2: Calculate u·u
u·u = 1² + (-2)² + 4² = 1 + 4 + 16 = 21

Step 3: Find parallel component
y_parallel = (-26/21)u = [-26/21, 52/21, -104/21]

Step 4: Find perpendicular component
y_orthogonal = y - y_parallel = [26/21, 11/21, -1/21]
```

### 4.3 Properties to Remember
1. w₁ is parallel to v
2. w₂ is perpendicular to v
3. u = w₁ + w₂
4. w₁ ⊥ w₂

### 5.2 Practice Problem
```
Problem: Find the orthogonal projection of u = [2, 3] onto v = [1, 1]

Solution:
1. Calculate u·v = (2×1) + (3×1) = 5
2. Calculate ||v||² = 1² + 1² = 2
3. w₁ = (5/2)[1, 1] = [5/2, 5/2]
4. w₂ = [2, 3] - [5/2, 5/2] = [-1/2, 1/2]

Check: w₁·w₂ should equal 0
(-1/2)(5/2) + (1/2)(5/2) = -5/4 + 5/4 = 0 ✓

## 6. Gram-Schmidt Process

### 6.1 Purpose

- Converts any basis into an orthogonal or orthonormal basis

- Maintains the same span while creating orthogonal vectors

- Useful for creating better bases for subspaces

### 6.2 Process Steps

Starting with vectors {x₁, x₂, ..., xₚ}, create orthogonal vectors {v₁, v₂, ..., vₚ}:

1. v₁ = x₁

2. v₂ = x₂ - proj_v₁(x₂)

   = x₂ - (x₂·v₁/v₁·v₁)v₁

3. v₃ = x₃ - proj_v₁(x₃) - proj_v₂(x₃)

   = x₃ - (x₃·v₁/v₁·v₁)v₁ - (x₃·v₂/v₂·v₂)v₂

And so on...

### 6.3 Visual Representation

   |/          |  /           |

   O           v₁             v₁,v₂

```

### 6.4 Key Properties

1. Each vᵢ is orthogonal to all previous vectors

2. span{v₁,...,vᵢ} = span{x₁,...,xᵢ} for all i

3. The resulting vectors form an orthogonal basis

### 6.5 Creating Orthonormal Basis

To get an orthonormal basis:

1. Complete Gram-Schmidt process to get orthogonal vectors

2. Normalize each vector: û = u/||u||

```

Example:

If v₁ = [3, 0, 0]

Then û₁ = [1, 0, 0]

If v₂ = [1, 2, 0]

Then û₂ = [1/√5, 2/√5, 0]

```

### 6.6 Worked Example

```

Given basis vectors:

x₁ = [1, 1, 0]

x₂ = [0, 1, 1]

Step 1: v₁ = x₁ = [1, 1, 0]

Step 2: 

v₂ = x₂ - (x₂·v₁/v₁·v₁)v₁

   = [0, 1, 1] - ([0,1,1]·[1,1,0]/([1,1,0]·[1,1,0]))[1,1,0]

   = [0, 1, 1] - (1/2)[1, 1, 0]

   = [-1/2, 1/2, 1]

Check orthogonality:

v₁·v₂ = 1(-1/2) + 1(1/2) + 0(1) = 0 ✓

```
